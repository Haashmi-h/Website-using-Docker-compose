# Website-using-Docker-compose
Hosting a simple website using Docker compose method.

</br>
</br>
Docker compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, we use a yaml file to configure the applicationâ€™s services.
Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.</br>

Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:
</br>

> Start, stop, and rebuild services

> View the status of running services

> Stream the log output of running services

> Run a one-off command on a service
</br>


#### The key features of Compose that make it effective are:

*Have multiple isolated environments on a single host* </br>
*Preserves volume data when containers are created* </br>
*Only recreate containers that have changed* </br>
*Supports variables and moving a composition between environments* </br>

</br>
We are hosting a website via Docker container using the resources passed via Docker compose.</br>

### Installation of Docker Composer:

 Installed composer and provided execute permission.

```sh
[ec2-user@instance1 ~]$ sudo curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.6.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/bin/docker-comp ose

[ec2-user@instance1 ~]$ sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose
[ec2-user@instance1 ~]$
[ec2-user@instance1 ~]$ docker-compose version
Docker Compose version v2.6.0
[ec2-user@instance1 ~]$
```

You can refer to [Docker compose Installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Created a project directory, then inserted yaml file and uploaded contents from a website template to another folder "webfiles":

```sh
[ec2-user@instance1 ~]$ mkdir web-project
[ec2-user@instance1 ~]$ cd web-project/
[ec2-user@instance1 web-project]$ 
[ec2-user@instance1 web-project]$ ll webfiles/
total 24

drwxrwxr-x 2 ec2-user ec2-user    78 Sep 30  2021 css

[ec2-user@instance1 web-project]$
```
</br>

##### Entered the docker-compose.yml and Executed using "docker compose".

```sh
[ec2-user@instance1 web-project]$ docker-compose config
name: web-project
services:
  web:
    container_name: webhost
    image: httpd:alpine
    networks:
      webntw: null
    ports:
    - mode: ingress
      target: 80
      published: "8080"
      protocol: tcp
    restart: always
    volumes:
    - type: bind
      source: /home/ec2-user/web-project/webfiles
      target: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
      bind:
        create_host_path: true
networks:
  webntw:
    name: web-project_webntw

```

</br>

The above YAML file contains creation of following services: </br>
1) Service definition to create a container with name, docker image, network, port publishing, restart policy and volume to bind mount.
2) Creation of custom network(bridge by default). 

</br>

Created container from this:

```sh
[ec2-user@instance1 web-project]$ docker-compose up -d
